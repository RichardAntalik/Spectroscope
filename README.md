# Spectroscope
Python openCV based webcam spectroscope

I was looking for nearly one day for usable DIY spectrope sofware. None was found. Some were so advanced, that they failed to even open webcam...

I am not saying that this masterpiece is good or anything, just that it is usable for me - eg I can at least calibrate range so I can see peaks and read out wavelength.
There are still stupidities that could be resolved, but maybe later... These include
 - I am probably abusing matplotlib, but it kinda works.
 - I was about to stream data through websockets to at least display it in browser, but WTF happened to javascript ecosystem? It felt like learning to use some obscure OS... Also plotting engines were barely usable.
 - "GUI" is a bit scattered.
 - Code is garbage, but I don't care.
